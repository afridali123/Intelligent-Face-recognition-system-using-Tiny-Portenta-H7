# Intelligent Face recognition system using Tiny Arduino Portenta-H7

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces. we have many algorithms and approaches are there but the challenge is optimizing and running this system on Tiny or edge computing devices.

In this project, I'm going to use Tiny Microcontroller board "Arduino Portenta H7". Its small formfactor board ; size of Small Fivestar or DiaryMilk chocolate.you can find specs of the board in this link - https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-H7

For the Proof of concept, i have trained with my own image dataset to recognise my face. without delays lets get started !!!

## Hardware Used :
	1.Arduino portenta H7
	2.Type C USB cable
## Software Used :
	1.Micro Python
	2.OpenMV IDE
